‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(m √ó n)
Where:

m = number of rows in the maze

n = number of columns

Explanation:
Each cell in the maze can be added to the queue at most once.

For each cell, you simulate rolling the ball in 4 directions, but:

The rolling continues until hitting a wall or boundary, not checking every cell repeatedly.

So although rolling may scan several cells per direction, the visited matrix prevents revisiting them.

‚û°Ô∏è Hence, even though you're scanning along paths, each cell is processed once ‚Üí total time: O(m √ó n)

‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(m √ó n)
visited matrix: O(m √ó n)

queue can hold up to O(m √ó n) positions in the worst case
