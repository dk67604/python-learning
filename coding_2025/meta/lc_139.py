âœ… Time Complexity: O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the input string s.

Explanation:

For each index start in the queue (at most n different positions), you may check up to n - start substrings by varying end from start + 1 to n.

Checking if s[start:end] is in the dictionary takes O(1) (thanks to the set).

Since each end index is processed only once (due to seen), the total number of substring checks is bounded by O(nÂ²).

âœ… Space Complexity: O(n + m), where:

n is the length of the input string s,

m is the total number of characters in wordDict.

Explanation:

words set takes O(m) space to store the dictionary.

queue and seen sets can store up to n indices â†’ O(n).

No extra space proportional to substrings or a DP table is used.

ðŸ§  Summary:
Time: O(nÂ²)

Space: O(n + m)
