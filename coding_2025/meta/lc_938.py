Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
Example 2:


Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23
Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
1 <= low <= high <= 105
All Node.val are unique.

âœ… Time Complexity: O(n)
Where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Why?
In the worst case, the function may need to visit every node in the tree.

Even though it prunes subtrees using the BST property, the pruning only happens when the node's value is clearly outside the range.

So in the worst-case scenario (e.g., all nodes fall inside [low, high]), the function visits every node.

ðŸš€ Best-case time complexity:
If most nodes are outside the range, the pruning reduces the number of nodes visited.

For example, if low = 50 and all nodes are < 50, you only traverse the rightmost path.

So best case is O(log n) for a balanced BST.

But overall, we say worst-case is O(n).

âœ… Space Complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree.

Why?
This is a recursive solution, so it uses the call stack.

In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the recursion can go as deep as n â†’ O(n).

In the best case (balanced BST), the recursion depth is log n â†’ O(log n)

So,

Worst case (unbalanced BST) â†’ O(n)

Best case (balanced BST) â†’ O(log n)
