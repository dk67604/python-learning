Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 109

âœ… Time Complexity: O(n log n * k)
Where:

n = number of elements in nums

k = average length of the numbers (as strings)

Explanation:
String conversion of each number takes O(n * k), where k is the average digit length of the numbers.

Sorting takes O(n log n) comparisons.

Each comparison involves concatenating two strings (n1 + n2 and n2 + n1), which takes O(k) time.

So total sorting complexity is O(n log n * k)

Joining the strings at the end takes O(n * k) time.

So overall, the dominant term is O(n log n * k) due to the custom sort.

âœ… Space Complexity: O(n * k)
Explanation:

You store all numbers as strings â†’ O(n * k) space.

The sorted array and final joined string also take O(n * k) space.

ðŸ§  Summary:
Time Complexity: O(n log n * k)

Space Complexity: O(n * k)
