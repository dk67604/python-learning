Time Complexity: O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the input list nums.

Explanation:

Each element in the list has two choices: include or exclude.

This results in 2^n total subsets (the size of the power set).

Each subset is constructed in O(n) time (due to copying the list), but since we only copy when reaching the base case, and we have 2^n such cases, the total time complexity is O(2^n).

Space Complexity: O(n) (excluding the output)

Explanation:

The recursion stack and the current subset curr_subset can grow up to size n.

The result list res stores 2^n subsets, but that is not counted as auxiliary space â€” it's part of the required output.
