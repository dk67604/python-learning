ðŸ”§ push(x)
Time Complexity: O(1)

Why: Adding an element to the end of a Python list (append) takes constant time.

ðŸ”§ pop()
Time Complexity: Amortized O(1)
Worst-case: O(n)

Why:

If output stack is not empty, popping from it is O(1).

If output is empty, all elements from input are moved to output, which takes O(n) time only once for every n pushes.

Each element is moved from input to output only once, so across n operations, the total cost is O(n), resulting in amortized O(1) per operation.

ðŸ”§ peek()
Time Complexity: Amortized O(1)
Worst-case: O(n)

Why: Same reason as pop(). The transfer from input to output only happens once per element. Peeking the last element of a list is O(1).

ðŸ”§ empty()
Time Complexity: O(1)

Why: Simply checks if both stacks are empty using a logical and on two list checks.
