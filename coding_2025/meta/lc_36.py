Time Complexity: O(1)

Explanation:

The board size is fixed at 9x9 (standard Sudoku), so the number of iterations is constant: 9 * 9 = 81 cells.

Each check and insertion into a set is done in constant time, O(1).

Since the input size does not grow beyond 81 cells, the entire algorithm runs in constant time.

Space Complexity: O(1)

Explanation:

Although we use sets to store seen values for rows, columns, and subgrids, each can hold at most 9 digits (1â€“9).

Thus, the total space used is constant and does not scale with input size.
