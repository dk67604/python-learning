'''
ðŸ§© What is a CountDownLatch?
A CountDownLatch allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.

You initialize it with a count.

Threads call latch.wait() to wait until the count reaches zero.

Other threads call latch.count_down() to decrement the count.

When count hits zero, all waiting threads proceed.

âœ… Why it's more flexible than a Barrier?
A Barrier is resettable and requires a fixed number of parties.

A CountDownLatch:

Can have multiple waiters

Can be counted down from anywhere

Does not reset â€” itâ€™s a one-shot latch
